# Gardening

Welcome to the Gardening gem.  This gem will provide you with instructions and information on growing a variety of vegetables at your own home.  All vegetables listings will provide an overview of the plant, recommended varieties, cold tolerance, required sun, germination soil temperature or planting recommendations, the amount of time until harvest, and additional information on the plant.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gardening'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gardening

## Usage

To use this gem, run `ruby gardening/bin/gardening`. A menu will appear with instructions on selecting a vegetable to read more information on.  Once you have read the information, you will then be able to select whether you'd like to see more information on another vegetable or exit the program. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
